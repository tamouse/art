        I recently suffered the loss of my VPS. Rather than try to
        rebuild that whole thing, and especially since managing a
        server is no longer a fun hobby, I'm moving my websites to
        Github Pages.

        The art blog was being run as a WordPress site. The new one
        will be just a static site. WP doesn't fit into my workflow
        and I really don't like writing using the WP editor.
